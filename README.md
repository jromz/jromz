I'm a CCNA and CompTIA Security+ certified Cybersecurity student. I love solving problems, and I have the goal of working as a Cloud Network Engineer.

## Objective

My journey in cybersecurity has led me to develop a passion for internetworking, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Network Operations Center (NOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
